This is private for now as I don't know if BCO-DMO is ready to have their code available yet.\

All set with the biogeochemical data - I can go from BCO-DMO to CMAP in one Python notebook. Move this repository over the BIOS-SCOPE, but still keep it private.

I can now use the data in the frictionless/json file and put it into the CMAP format. Next step will be to get the metadata about the different variables.

Adam Shepard set up the script I need to access the data in BCO-DMO and the end result is a Frictionless data package. 

- [x] Convert the information in the Frictionless package to the CMAP format
- [x] Check out Adam's code

Keep this private for now as I am starting with code that is not yet publically available.
