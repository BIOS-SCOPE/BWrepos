I can now use the data in the frictionless/json file and put it into the CMAP format. Next step will be to get the metadata about the different variables.

Adam Shepard set up the script I need to access the data in BCO-DMO and the end result is a Frictionless data package. 

- [x] Convert the information in the Frictionless package to the CMAP format
- [x] Check out Adam's code

Keep this private for now as I am starting with code that is not yet publically available.
